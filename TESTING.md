Once the portal was up and running with functionality, I began testing it for any potential and obscure errors so that in the event of catching any I was able to fix them.

I went into the Railway Inn to speak with the manager and go through the employee portal with him. We tested it by implementing the current employees into the portal, and we then calculated their gross pay using the relevent options. One issue that we found is that due to the way the code has been written when retrieving the index values from the database, the last employee on the spreadsheet is not calculated. I fixed this within the code through adding +1 to the index values.
