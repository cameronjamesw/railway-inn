# The Railway Inn - Employee Portal

Image

The Railway Inn are an independent pub company based in the West-Midlands, United Kingdom. Having recently changed ownership, the new owners are looking to grow the business and take it to new heights. With an influx of new hires, it has become clear to the owners that the current pen & paper method of handling the books simply isn't going to suffice to the scale they are aiming for. In turn, the new Railway Inn Employee Portal aims to automize this process for the owners, whereby they can enter employee details onto a databse, as well as calculate the wages for the employees. 

# Contents

# Introduction

The Railway Inn Employee Portal allows employees of the Railway Inn to view their expected pay based off of the hours that thwy have worked within a given pay period. Similtaneously, both the gross-pay and net-pay will be pushed to a Google Sheets document for the benefit of HR.  The portal allows HR to create employee profiles within the portal which will allow easy access to key information of any given employee with no hassle.

# Project

- The aim of this project is to:
    - Allows the manager a way of accessing employee data with the click of a button
    - Save time for the manager of the Railway Inn by automatically calculating pay
    - Accesses contracted hours and calculates pay for a given employee
    - Allows employees of the Railway Inn a way of accessing their expected gross and net pay
    - Provides clear instructions of how to utilise the employee portal

## User Goals

The user will be able to access their expected pay through the employee portal prior to getting paid by the Railway Inn.

## Site Owner Goals

With the recent change of ownership of the Railway Inn, the new owners see it fit to implement an employee portal which will halve the workload of the pub-mamager. Here the manager (site owner) will be able to create an employee profile for any new employee that joins the business through following simple instructions and entering inputs. Upon confirmation of the amount of hours worked by an amployee, the manager will be able to use the employee portal to calculate the expected pay of any given employee granted they exist in the database.
