# The Railway Inn - Employee Portal

Image

The Railway Inn are an independent pub company based in the West-Midlands, United Kingdom. Having recently changed ownership, the new owners are looking to grow the business and take it to new heights. With an influx of new hires, it has become clear to the owners that the current pen & paper method of handling the books simply isn't going to suffice to the scale they are aiming for. In turn, the new Railways Inn Employee Portal aims to automize this process for the owners, whereby they can enter employee details onto a databse, as well as calculate the wages for the employees.
